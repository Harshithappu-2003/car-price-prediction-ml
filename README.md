# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the selling price of used cars based on various attributes like manufacturing year, fuel type, kilometers driven, transmission type, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

Buying or selling a used car often comes with uncertainty regarding its fair market price. This project aims to eliminate that guesswork using **machine learning**. 

We use a dataset of used cars to build a **Linear Regression model** that accurately predicts the car price based on factors like:

- Car manufacturing year
- Kilometers driven
- Fuel type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
- Transmission (Manual/Automatic)
- Ownership type
- Number of previous owners

The entire process includes:
- **Data cleaning**: Handling missing values and transforming data types
- **Feature engineering**: Selecting relevant features for prediction
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing patterns and correlations
- **Model building**: Using `scikit-learn` to train and test a regression model
- **Evaluation**: Visualizing prediction vs actual prices and checking performance using RÂ² score


## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

The model shows a strong correlation between actual and predicted prices, proving its potential use in online used car portals or dealership software.
